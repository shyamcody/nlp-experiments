<p> tag:
The <p> tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tag. So anything mentioned within <p> and </p> is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we don’t use the closing tag i.e, </p>, but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is both a good convention and we must use the closing tag.
Syntax:
 <p> Content </p> 
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
    <title>Paragraph</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <p>A Computer Science portal for geeks.</p> 
    <p>It contains well written, well thought articles.</p> 
</body> 
</html> 
Output:
When we look at the webpage, we see that there are few spaces added before and after a paragraph. HTML does this by default. Let’s look at few properties of paragraph tag:
As already mentioned, the<p>tag automatically adds space before and after any paragraph, which is basically margins added by the browser.
If a user adds multiple spaces, the browser reduces them it to a single space.
If a user adds multiple lines, the browser reduces them to a single line.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
    <title>Display_Paragraph</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <p> 
    This paragraph has multiple 
    lines. But HTML reduces them 
    to a single line, omitting 
    the carriage return we have used. 
    </p>       
    <p> 
    This paragraph    has multiple spaces. But HTML reduces them all to a single space,omitting 
    the extra spaces and line   we have used. </p> 
</body> 
</html> 
Output:
<br> tag:
There is a way to let the HTML know where does the browser need to change the lines by the use of <br> tag. These tags do not have any closing tag. So, just a single opening tag will change the line.
Syntax:
 <br> 
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
    <title>Display_Paragraph</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <p> 
    This paragraph has multiple<br>lines.  
    But HTML reduces them<br>to a single 
    line, omitting<br>the carriage return 
    we have used. 
    </p> 
</body> 
</html> 
Output:
<align> attribute:
The <p> tag specifically supports the alignment attribute and allows us to align our paragraphs in left, right or center alignment.
Syntax:
<p align="value">
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
    <title>Paragraph</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <p align="center">Welcome Geeks</p> 
    <p align="left">A Computer Science  
                  portal for geeks.</p> 
    <p align="right">It contains well 
    written, well thought articles.</p> 
</body> 
</html> 
Output:
The <pre> element:
We have seen how the paragraph tag ignores all the change of lines and extra spaces within a paragraph, but there is a way to preserve this by the use of <pre> tag. It also contains an opening and a closing tag. It displays a text within a fixed height and width and preserves the extra lines and spaces we use.
Syntax:
 <pre> Content </pre> 
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
    <title>Display_Paragraph</title> 
</head> 
<body> 
    <pre> 
    This paragraph has multiple 
    lines. But it is displayed  
    as it is unlike the paragraph  
    tag. 
    </pre>    
    <pre> 
    This     paragraph has multiple 
    spaces. But     it is displayed  
    as it is    unlike the paragraph  
         tag. 
    </pre> 
</body> 
</html>
